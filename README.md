Identifying Viral Tweets with a supervised classifier (Our guineau pig is Trump)

## Points to consider

### Preprocessing
We currenlty normalize the features with a TF-IDF transformation: http://www.tfidf.com

2. What to do with the tagged people (e.g. @periscopeco)? 
3. What to do with links / images / videos ?
